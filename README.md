# 8puzzle-AI-algorithms-implementation
I implemented a Breadth-First Search (BFS), Uniform-Cost Search (UCS), Best-First Search (BFS), and A* Algorithm to solve an 8-puzzle problem. The 8-puzzle consists of eight numbered, movable tiles set in a 3x3 frame. One cell of the frame is 
always empty thus making it possible to move an adjacent numbered tile into the empty cell. Start with a random state (cannot be fixed). The goal state is [1,2,3,8,0,4,7,6,5]
